Problem 3)

	a)
	
	 area= (1*10+2*2+3*23+4*4+5*5+6*9+7*12+8*7+9*3+10*2)*10 um^2
	 area= 3650 um^2(square micrometers)
	 
	 throughput= 1(input-instruction)/delay
	 throughput= 1/10 instructions/ns
	 
	 latency= worst case delay
	 latency= 10 * 1 ns= 10 ns

	b)If you added registers between every lut, you could increase your clock
	cycle significantly. Your clock period would only have to be ever slightly
	greater than the delay of 1 lut and 1 register. Essentially we would be pipelining
	the circuit. There would be no real benefit to throughtput to increasing your clock cycle this way
	if you only ever wanted to run one input through the logic. However if you run multiple
	inputs in quick succession you will greatly increase your throughput.
	
	The max frequency it can operate at with this method is 1/(1.5 ns)
	which is 2/3 a Ghz!

	c) area = oldarea + registers area
	   area= 3650 + (1*2+2*23+3*4+4*5+5*9+6*12+7*7+8*3+9*2)*6 um^2
	   area= 5378 um^2
	   
	   N= number of inputs-instructions//ran conssecutive	
	   throughput = (N)/(1*latency+(N-1)*clock period)
	   throughput = N/(14.5 ns + (N-1)*1.5 ns)
	   for N= 1 throughput= 1/14.5 inst/ns
	   for N= 10 throughput= 10/28= 5/14 inst/ns
	   for N approching infinity throughput is 1/1.5 inst/ns
	   of course N rarely approches infinity...
	   
	   latency= old latency + latentcy of registers on last level
	   latency= 10ns + 9*.5 ns
	   latency= 14.5 ns
