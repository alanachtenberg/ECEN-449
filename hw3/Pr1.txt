Problem 1)

	a)
	grep ^11 log.txt >> results.txt
	
	 Using >> we redirect the output of the grep command into our results file.
	Since we know we are looking at a log file where lines always begins in a 
	timestap we simply need to search for lines that start with 11. There is no 
	need to	use regex to determine if the 11 is part of a date.

	b)
	echo How are you doing $USER? You are in $(pwd)

	 The $ denotes a bash variable, $USER is the current user name.
	Using the () around pwd allows you to use a command like you would
	a variable.
	
	c)
	top -U rickshaw
	
	 top is a unix/linux command line inteface for displaying the currently running
	processes. Adding the -U option allows you to specify of which user the processes
	must belong to, to be displayed.
	
	d)
	which firefox
	
	 which will display the path to the executable targeted by the command firefox.
	The & symbol just starts a process in the background, meaning that the location
	of firefox and firefox & are the same.

	e)
	ln -s /home/users/rickshaw/file.txt linked_file

	 This command creates a file "linked_file" that is symbolically linked to
	/home/users/rickshaw.file.txt Any changes to linked_file are actually changes 
	to file.txt. linked_file acts as a file pointer.
