Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,083 out of  17,280    6%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,775
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           829 out of   2,775   29%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             347 out of  69,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                        17 out of     640    2%
    IOB Flip Flops:                             16

    Total primitives used:
      Number of 36k BlockRAM used:              32
    Total Memory used (KB):                  1,152 out of   5,328   21%
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      3 out of      32    9%
