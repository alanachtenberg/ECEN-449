    Running clock generation algorithm ...
    For FAMILY is virtex5, using PLL+DCM architecture
    Step 1: Try to generate required clocks that:
      { Frequency: 0Hz < frequency <= 400MHz
        Phase: any
        Group: PLL0 or PLL0_ADJUST or PLL1 or PLL1_ADJUST
        Not external feedback
      }
    Step 2: Try to generate required clocks that:
      { Frequency: 0Hz < frequency <= 400MHz
        Phase: any
        Group: NONE
        Not external feedback
      }
      There are 1 required clocks are not generated
      Try to generate 1 of them in this step
      Required clock: CLKOUT0
      1. Try to use already instanced PLL's CLKOUTs
        { Try to use instanced PLL's CLKOUT for CLKOUT0
          Can not connect CLKGEN's CLKOUT0 to instanced PLL
        }
      2. Try to instance a PLL and connect to CLKGEN's CLKIN then use its CLKOUTs
        { Try to instance PLL and connect its CLKIN to CLKIN
          Instance PLL0 from CLKGEN's CLKIN
        }
        { Try to use instanced PLL's CLKOUT for CLKOUT0
            try any-group PLL0
          Connect CLKGEN's CLKOUT0 to PLL0.CLKOUT0
        }
    Step 3: Try to generate required clocks that:
      { Frequency: 0Hz < frequency <= 400MHz
        Phase: 0
        Group: NONE
        External feedback
      }
    Summary of using PLL with DCM for external feedback architecture
      All required clocks are successfully generated
