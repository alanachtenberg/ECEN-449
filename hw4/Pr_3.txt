Problem 3)

a)
  The minimum number of clock cycles would be when the interupt occured exactly on
the posedge of the clock. 1000 cycles for the context switch and then 50 cycles for the handler.
1050*(1/(1 Ghz))= 1.05 microseconds

  The max would occur when the interupt occurs just after the posedge, meaning the processor would
not detect the interupt until the next cycle. 1 cycle for waiting to detect, 1000 for the context, and
50 for the handler
1051*(1/(1 Ghz))= 1.051 microseconds

b)
  The minimum is when it occurs at the time it is being polled. Meaning it will only take 50 cycles to handle the event. 
50 * 1 ns = 50 ns

  The maximum is when it occurs just after being polled. It will take
500 ns to be polled again and 50 ns to be handled
500ns +50 ns = 550 ns
