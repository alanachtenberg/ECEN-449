Problem 1)

Sythesis)
	The sythesis stage is the same for ASIC and FPGA, hdl description
is used to generate a netlist (boolean circuit).

Technology Mapping)
	For the FPGA the netlist is converted into a series of equivialent k input LUTs
where each LUT implements any k input logic of the netlist. For the ASIC the  netlist is converted
into a series of standard cells generally given by the ASIC manufacturer and typically gate level.

Place)
	For the FPGA the LUTs from our mapping is programmed to later be in LUTs in the FPGA. For
the ASIC the standard cells are placed onto a region representing the yet to be manufactured ASIC

Route)
	For the FPGA the interconnections are programmed on the existing FPGA. For the ASIC the interconnections
of the standard cells are placed onto the same region as the standard cells and are yet to be manufactured.

Output Generation)
	For the FPGA a bitstream is generated consisting of the bits from the Place step and the bits from the Route
step and is serially programmed into existing hardware (can take a couple seconds). For the ASIC the region information
is sent to a manufacturer in the form of a file which then produces the physical IC's (can take a couple of months).
