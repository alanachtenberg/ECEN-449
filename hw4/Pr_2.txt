Problem 2)

	a)
	  Levelizing the circuit L3 is level 2 and L1 & L2 are level 1
The max delay of L1 is from c (4*5+10=30 us). The max delay from L2 is
from e (4*5+10= 30 us). The max delay from L2 is l1 (2*5+10= 20 us). Finally
delay from L3 to the output is (4*5= 20 us). The total delay with the inputs at
level 0 and the output at level 3 is 30+20+20 us = 70 us

	b)
	  The optimal placement of The luts is where L1 is placed in [2,2] L2 is placed
in [2,1] and L3 is placed in [3,2]. The delay of the circuit is 45 us.

This can be shown, because we have the delay of transmission being 5(i-j+k-l) and the delay
of the lut being 10. ignoring the delay of the lut because it is constant we just need to minimize
the total transmission delays. The min transmission delay for L1 is 5(i-j+k-l) where i and k are substituted
for positions of a b and c that give the min and j&l is the position chosen for L1. The min transmission 
delay for L2 is 5(i-j+k-l) where i and k are substituted for positions of a d and e that give the min and j&l
is the positon chosen for L2. The delay of L3 is 5 (i-j+k-l) where i and k are positions of L1 and L2 and where j&l 
is the position chosen for L3. Finally the delay fo the ouput is 5(i-(2)+k-(4)) where 2 and 4 is the position of the output and i&k
are possible positions of L3. Substituing the above equations one can find a minimum solution.
